## TESTIMONIAL #1: Sarah & Mike Johnson (First-Time Buyers)

### ORIGINAL
"Dr. Duffy helped us buy our dream home in Summerlin for $850K in March 2024. Despite multiple competing offers, her negotiation skills got us the house at asking price. The entire process took just 18 days from offer to closing."

### ENHANCED (Full Version)
"After losing 3 homes to cash buyers and bidding wars, we were exhausted and ready to give up.

We closed in 18 days, stress-free, and saved enough to renovate the kitchen."

We accepted $125K over asking—enough to buy our Arizona retirement home in cash, no mortgage needed."

### ENHANCED (Full Version)
"I was buying random properties based on Zillow listings and losing money every month. Dr. Jan mapped out emerging Las Vegas neighborhoods before they peaked, found 3 undervalued properties with forced-appreciation potential, and structured deals that cash-flowed from day one. My portfolio is now $2.3M, generating $8,200/month passive income—up 340% from my first struggling property. Her market timing isn't luck; it's strategic."

## TESTIMONIAL #4: Jennifer & David Thompson (Luxury Buyers)

### ORIGINAL
"Found our $1.2M luxury home in The Ridges in November 2023. Dr. Duffy's connections in the luxury market gave us access to off-market properties. We got exactly what we wanted without the bidding wars."

### ENHANCED (Full Version)
"Every luxury home we wanted had Bulletin of Sales posted—multiple offers, $200K+ over asking. Dr. Jan leveraged her private network to access an off-market listing in The Ridges that matched our exact specifications (mountain views, 3-car garage, pool). We negotiated directly with the seller, avoided bidding wars entirely, and closed at fair market value: $1.2M for a home that would've cost $1.4M+ in a public listing frenzy."

## TESTIMONIAL #5: Maria Rodriguez (First-Time Seller)

### ORIGINAL
"Sold our North Las Vegas home for $95K above our target price in January 2024. Dr. Duffy's marketing strategy included professional photography and virtual tours that attracted buyers from California. Closed in 14 days."

### ENHANCED (Full Version)
"As a first-time seller, I feared pricing too low and leaving money on the table—or pricing too high and sitting for months. Dr. Jan's comparative market analysis pinpointed the sweet spot, and her professional photography + 3D virtual tours attracted 12 showings from California buyers in the first week. We accepted an offer $95K above our original target, closed in 14 days, and used the proceeds to upgrade to a larger home for our growing family."
