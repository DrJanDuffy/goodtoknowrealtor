## Overview

Testimonials have been moved from section 5 to **section 2** (right after hero). The implementation includes:
- **Hero Testimonial Carousel**: 3-5 short testimonials that auto-rotate

---

## 2. Styling Recommendations

### Carousel Behavior
✅ **Auto-rotate**: Yes, every 5 seconds  
✅ **Pause on hover**: Yes, pauses when user hovers over carousel  
✅ **Manual navigation**: Yes, arrow buttons (desktop) + dot navigation (all devices)

### Visibility
- **Mobile**: 1 testimonial visible at a time
- **Desktop**: 1 testimonial visible (optimized for readability)

### Animation Style
- **Type**: Fade + subtle slide (opacity + y-axis movement)
- **Duration**: 0.5 seconds
- **Library**: Framer Motion (already in dependencies)

### Responsive Design
- Text scales: `text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl` for quotes
- Author info stacks vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop
- Navigation arrows hidden on mobile (dots only)

---

## 3. Full Testimonials Section

### Layout Recommendation
✅ **Keep 3-column grid** - Works well for 6 testimonials
- **Mobile**: 1 column
- **Tablet**: 2 columns  
- **Desktop**: 3 columns

### Enhancements Made
1. **Key Metrics Badges**: Dollar amount and timeline displayed as colored badges
2. **Full Detailed Quotes**: Complete transformation stories
3. **Property Type Indicators**: Visual distinction between buyer/seller/investor
4. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better spacing, hover effects

### Alternative Layout Options (if needed later)
- **Carousel with dots**: Would work but grid shows all testimonials at once (better for trust)
- **2-column featured**: Could highlight 4 testimonials, link to full testimonials page
- **Masonry layout**: Visual interest but harder to scan quickly

---

## 4. Data Structure Template

### Location
`src/data/testimonials.ts`

### Template for New Testimonials
```typescript
{
  id: number,                    // Unique ID (increment from last)

## 5. Metrics to Track

### Recommended Analytics Events

#### Carousel Interactions
```javascript
// Track carousel views
'testimonial_carousel_view' // When carousel is visible

// Track navigation
'testimonial_carousel_next_click'
'testimonial_carousel_prev_click'
'testimonial_carousel_dot_click' // With testimonial_id

// Track engagement
'testim Did you mean: testimonial_carousel_pause' // When user hovers (indicates engagement)
'testimonial_carousel_complete_rotation' // User saw all testimonials
```

#### Testimonial-Specific
```javascript
// Track which testimonials get most attention
'testimonial_viewed' // { testimonial_id, section: 'carousel' | 'grid' }
'testimonial_read_time' // Time spent viewing (if scroll tracking)
```

#### Conversion Metrics
```javascript
// Track if testimonials lead to actions
'cta_click_after_testimonial' // User clicked CTA after viewing testimonials
'contact_form_start_after_testimonial'
'phone_call_after_testimonial'
```

### Google Analytics 4 Setup
```javascript
// Example tracking (add to carousel component)
gtag('event', 'testimonial_carousel_view', {
  'testimonial_count': heroTestimonials.length,
  'section': 'hero'
});

gtag('event', 'testimonial_viewed', {
  'testimonial_id': currentTestimonial.id,
  'author': currentTestimonial.author,
  'property_type': currentTestimonial.propertyType,
  'section': 'carousel'
});
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

2. **Complete Rotation Rate**: % of users who see all testimonials
3. **Conversion After Viewing**: % who contact after viewing testimonials
4. **Most Viewed Testimonials**: Which testimonials get most attention
